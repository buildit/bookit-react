# Bookit Iteration #9: Demo Plan

Demo date: Wednesday June 28, 2017

## Inviting a Wipro user

1) Log in to Bookit as Rasmus, a user with administrative permissions.
2) Click 'Admin' to view the admin panel.
3) Click '+' to add a user.
4) Enter an email address in the form. We're using one of our demo accounts, Barbra Streisand, who is standing in as a Wipro user. (Sorry, Babs.)
5) Click 'invite.'
6) See:
- A message confirming that the user was added.
- The user is added to the 'Wipro' team list.
7) Log in to Outlook as Babs.
8) See an email inviting me to Bookit.

## Notes
This does really add the user to anything on the backend. If you refresh the browser, you'll see Barbra disappear from the list. We are still working out the kinks with the Microsoft service that will allow us to fully implement that feature. The email, however, is real.
